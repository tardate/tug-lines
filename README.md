# TUG Lines

Historical archive of "TUG Lines", the communications of the Programmer Resource Organization.

[ISSN 0892-4961](https://journalseeker.researchbib.com/view/issn/0892-4961) is the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) for the journal TUG lines. Specifically, it is associated with the 1991 volume of TUG lines, issue number 0, page 0.

TUG Lines was published from 1991 until at least 1993. I can find little information about it, and few references exist on the internet.

I recently found some old issues that I am archiving here (from when I was a member). Perhaps I can find more in future.
